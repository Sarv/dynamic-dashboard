## Overview

The Elasticsearch Aggregation Query Result Simplifier is a JavaScript module designed to parse and simplify complex, nested Elasticsearch aggregation query results. It transforms the hierarchical structure of Elasticsearch aggregations into a flat array of objects, making it easier to process and analyze the data.

## Problem Statement

Elasticsearch aggregation queries often return deeply nested and complex JSON structures, especially when dealing with multiple levels of bucket aggregations and metric aggregations. This complexity can make it challenging to:

1. Extract relevant data from the result
2. Process the results programmatically
3. Present the data in a tabular format or for further analysis

## Solution

Our solution involves creating a parser that:

1. Traverses the nested structure of the Elasticsearch result
2. Flattens the hierarchy into an array of objects
3. Preserves the relationship between parent and child buckets
4. Includes metric values from the deepest level of nesting
5. Handles cases where certain buckets or metrics may be missing or null

The parser uses a mapping object that describes the structure of the aggregations, allowing it to correctly interpret and flatten the results.

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

The implementation is contained in a single file: `simplifier-aggregation-query-result.js`

### Main Function: parseAggregationResult

```javascript
function parseAggregationResult(result, mapping) {
    const parsedResults = [];
    // ... (implementation details)
    return parsedResults;
}
```

This is the main entry point of the module. It takes two parameters:
- `result`: The Elasticsearch aggregation query result
- `mapping`: An object describing the structure of the aggregations

It returns an array of simplified, flattened result objects.

### Helper Function: traverse

```javascript
function traverse(currentResult, currentMapping, currentPath = {}) {
    // ... (implementation details)
}
```

This recursive function is responsible for:
1. Traversing the nested structure of the Elasticsearch result
2. Building the flattened result objects
3. Handling both main_axis (bucket) and value_axis (metric) aggregations

Key aspects of the traverse function:
- It uses the `mapping` object to understand the structure of the result
- It builds up a `currentPath` object as it traverses the nested structure
- It handles main_axis aggregations by recursively processing their buckets
- It processes value_axis aggregations when it reaches the deepest level of nesting
- It adds completed result objects to the `parsedResults` array

## Input and Output Formats

### Input: Elasticsearch Result

The Elasticsearch result is expected to be a JSON object with an `aggregations` property containing the nested aggregation results. Example structure:

```json
{
  "aggregations": {
    "0": {
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "value1",
          "doc_count": 100,
          "1": {
            "buckets": [
              {
                "key": "subvalue1",
                "doc_count": 50,
                "2": { "value": 25.5 },
                "3": { "value": 1000 }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Input: Mapping Object

The mapping object describes the structure of the aggregations. Example structure:

```json
{
  "0": {
    "aggNum": "0",
    "axisType": "main_axis",
    "axisIndex": 0,
    "child": {
      "1": {
        "aggNum": "1",
        "axisType": "main_axis",
        "axisIndex": 1,
        "child": {
          "2": {
            "aggNum": "2",
            "axisType": "value_axis",
            "axisIndex": 0
          },
          "3": {
            "aggNum": "3",
            "axisType": "value_axis",
            "axisIndex": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Output: Simplified Result

The output is an array of flattened objects. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "0": "value1",
    "0_doc_count": 100,
    "1": "subvalue1",
    "1_doc_count": 50,
    "2": 25.5,
    "3": 1000
  }
]
```

## Key Concepts and Design Decisions

1. **Separation of main_axis and value_axis**: 
   - main_axis represents bucket aggregations (terms, date_histogram, etc.)
   - value_axis represents metric aggregations (sum, avg, etc.)

2. **Use of a mapping object**: 
   - Provides flexibility in interpreting different aggregation structures
   - Allows the parser to understand the hierarchy and types of aggregations

3. **Flattening of nested structures**: 
   - Simplifies further processing and analysis of the data
   - Preserves the hierarchical information through naming conventions (e.g., "0", "1" for different levels)

4. **Inclusion of doc_count**: 
   - Adds "_doc_count" fields to provide bucket size information

5. **Handling of null or missing values**: 
   - Ensures that all defined aggregations are included in the output, even if they're null in the result

## Usage Examples

```javascript
const { parseAggregationResult } = require('./simplifier-aggregation-query-result');

const esResult = {
  // Your Elasticsearch result here
};

const mapping = {
  // Your mapping object here
};

const parsedData = parseAggregationResult(esResult, mapping);
console.log(JSON.stringify(parsedData, null, 2));
```


## Detailed Explanation of parseAggregationResult Function

The `parseAggregationResult` function is the core of our Elasticsearch Aggregation Query Result Simplifier. Let's break down its implementation and explain how it works.

### Function Signature

```javascript
function parseAggregationResult(result, mapping) {
    const parsedResults = [];
    // ... (implementation)
    return parsedResults;
}
```

### Parameters

1. `result`: The Elasticsearch aggregation query result object.
2. `mapping`: An object describing the structure of the aggregations.

### Return Value

An array of simplified, flattened result objects.

### Internal Workings

#### 1. Initialization

```javascript
const parsedResults = [];
```

This array will store all the flattened result objects.

#### 2. The traverse Function

The `parseAggregationResult` function defines an inner `traverse` function:

```javascript
function traverse(currentResult, currentMapping, currentPath = {}) {
    // ... (implementation)
}
```

This function is responsible for recursively traversing the nested structure of the Elasticsearch result.

#### 3. Traversing the Structure

The `traverse` function iterates over each key in the `currentMapping`:

```javascript
Object.keys(currentMapping).forEach(key => {
    const aggInfo = currentMapping[key];
    const aggResult = currentResult?.aggregations?.[key] ?? currentResult?.[key];
    // ... (processing logic)
});
```

This allows it to process each aggregation defined in the mapping.

#### 4. Handling Main Axis Aggregations

For main_axis (bucket) aggregations:

```javascript
if (aggInfo.axisType === 'main_axis') {
    if (aggResult && aggResult.buckets) {
        aggResult.buckets.forEach(bucket => {
            const newPath = { 
                ...currentPath, 
                [aggInfo.aggNum]: bucket.key,
                [`${aggInfo.aggNum}_doc_count`]: bucket.doc_count
            };
            if (aggInfo.child) {
                traverse(bucket, aggInfo.child, newPath);
            } else {
                parsedResults.push(newPath);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This code:
- Checks if the current aggregation is a main_axis type
- Processes each bucket in the aggregation
- Creates a new path object with the current bucket's key and doc_count
- Recursively traverses child aggregations if they exist
- Pushes the result to `parsedResults` if it's a leaf node

#### 5. Handling Value Axis Aggregations

For value_axis (metric) aggregations:

```javascript
else if (aggInfo.axisType === 'value_axis') {
    Object.keys(currentMapping).forEach(valueKey => {
        const valueAggInfo = currentMapping[valueKey];
        if (valueAggInfo.axisType === 'value_axis') {
            const valueResult = currentResult[valueKey];
            currentPath[valueAggInfo.aggNum] = valueResult ? valueResult.value : null;
        }
    });
    parsedResults.push(currentPath);
    return;
}
```

This code:
- Processes all value_axis aggregations at the current level
- Adds each metric value to the current path
- Pushes the completed path to `parsedResults`
- Returns to stop further traversal, as value_axis aggregations are always leaf nodes

#### 6. Initiating the Traversal

The traversal is initiated with:

```javascript
traverse(result.aggregations, mapping);
```

This starts the process at the top level of the Elasticsearch result and mapping.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through a simple example to illustrate how `parseAggregationResult` works:

Elasticsearch Result:
```json
{
  "aggregations": {
    "0": {
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "category1",
          "doc_count": 100,
          "1": {
            "value": 50.5
          }
        },
        {
          "key": "category2",
          "doc_count": 150,
          "1": {
            "value": 75.5
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Mapping:
```json
{
  "0": {
    "aggNum": "0",
    "axisType": "main_axis",
    "axisIndex": 0,
    "child": {
      "1": {
        "aggNum": "1",
        "axisType": "value_axis",
        "axisIndex": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Process:
1. The function starts at the top level ("0" aggregation).
2. It identifies "0" as a main_axis aggregation and processes its buckets.
3. For each bucket, it creates a new path with the bucket's key and doc_count.
4. It then processes the child aggregation "1", identified as a value_axis.
5. The value of aggregation "1" is added to the path.
6. The completed path is pushed to `parsedResults`.
7. This process repeats for each bucket.

Result:
```json
[
  {
    "0": "category1",
    "0_doc_count": 100,
    "1": 50.5
  },
  {
    "0": "category2",
    "0_doc_count": 150,
    "1": 75.5
  }
]
```

### Key Points

- The function handles arbitrary levels of nesting in main_axis aggregations.
- It correctly processes both bucket (main_axis) and metric (value_axis) aggregations.
- The mapping object is crucial for interpreting the structure of the Elasticsearch result.
- The function flattens the nested structure while preserving the hierarchical information through naming conventions.

This detailed explanation of `parseAggregationResult` should provide a clear understanding of how the function processes complex Elasticsearch aggregation results and transforms them into a simplified, flat structure.



## Limitations and Considerations

1. The parser assumes a specific structure of the Elasticsearch result and mapping object. Deviations from this structure may lead to unexpected results.

2. Very large result sets might consume significant memory when flattened.

3. The current implementation doesn't handle all possible Elasticsearch aggregation types. It's primarily designed for bucket and metric aggregations.

4. Error handling is minimal and might need to be enhanced for production use.

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more aggregation types (e.g., pipeline aggregations).

2. Implement more robust error handling and input validation.

3. Optimize memory usage for very large result sets.

4. Add options for customizing the output format.

5. Implement a streaming version for handling extremely large datasets.

6. Add unit tests to ensure reliability and ease future modifications.
