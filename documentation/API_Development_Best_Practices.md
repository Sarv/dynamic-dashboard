# API Development Best Practices

Here's a list of important instructions you can give throughout any project. These instructions reflect good practices and can be valuable for future projects:

1. Use different endpoints for create, update, list, and delete functionality, instead of using POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT methods.

2. Implement soft delete functionality instead of actually deleting records.

3. Create a mapping of fields in the constants file to allow fields to be updated via the update API.

4. Implement proper validations on every input according to the index mapping.

5. Create separate functions for validations to improve code organization and reusability.

6. Create a separate file for constants to centralize important values and improve maintainability.

7. Generate error codes in a uniform errorCode and message JSON format.

8. Mask field names in the API to abstract database field names from the client-side representation.

9. Handle nested fields properly, especially for complex structures like modules within dashboards.

10. In list API responses, show only selected fields instead of all database fields.

11. Create constants for allowed fields in list API responses (e.g., ALLOWED_FIELDS_IN_LIST_DASHBOARD).

12. Provide proper documentation for APIs, including field descriptions and error codes.

13. Present field descriptions and error codes in table format in API documentation for better readability.

14. Include expected response structures in API documentation.

15. Create comprehensive Markdown documentation covering file structure, constants, use cases, concepts, error codes, and API endpoints.

16. Implement consistent error handling across all endpoints.

17. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and constants.

18. Separate concerns by creating different files for routes, validations, error handling, and utility functions.

19. Implement field filtering to ensure only allowed fields are returned in responses.

20. Create reverse mappings for easy conversion between masked and database field names.

21. Handle both masked and unmasked field names in utility functions to improve flexibility.

22. Provide detailed console logging for debugging purposes.

23. Use environment variables for configuration (like Elasticsearch URL).

24. Create a Postman collection for easy API testing and sharing.
